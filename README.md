 ## Problem

Build a science explainer and come up with the design for a Flask application. The design should include the HTML files needed for the application along with different routes.

## Solution

The following is a design for a Flask application that will serve as a science explainer. The application will have three main routes:

* `/`: The home page, which will display a list of all the science topics that the application can explain.
* `/topic/<topic>`: A page that will display an explanation of a specific science topic.
* `/about`: A page that will provide information about the application and its creators.

The following HTML files will be needed for the application:

* `index.html`: The home page.
* `topic.html`: The page that will display an explanation of a specific science topic.
* `about.html`: The page that will provide information about the application and its creators.

The following routes will be needed for the application:

* `@app.route('/')`: The home page.
* `@app.route('/topic/<topic>')`: A page that will display an explanation of a specific science topic.
* `@app.route('/about')`: A page that will provide information about the application and its creators.

## Implementation

The following code can be used to implement the Flask application:

```python
from flask import Flask, render_template

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def home():
    return render_template('index.html')

@app.route('/topic/<topic>')
def topic(topic):
    return render_template('topic.html', topic=topic)

@app.route('/about')
def about():
    return render_template('about.html')

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run()
```

## Testing

The following steps can be used to test the Flask application:

1. Start the application by running the following command:

```
python app.py
```

2. Open a web browser and navigate to the following URL:

```
http://localhost:5000/
```

3. The home page should be displayed.

4. Click on a link to a specific science topic.

5. The page for that topic should be displayed.

6. Click on the "About" link.

7. The about page should be displayed.

## Deployment

The Flask application can be deployed to a production environment using the following steps:

1. Create a virtual environment for the application.

2. Install the Flask application into the virtual environment.

3. Create a WSGI file for the application.

4. Deploy the WSGI file to a web server.

5. Configure the web server to serve the application.
